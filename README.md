CoilMQ is a simple, configurable STOMP message broker (aka STOMP server) written in Python. This project is inspired by the simple design of the Ruby [stompserver project](http://stompserver.rubyforge.org/) by Patrick Hurley and Lionel Bouton. The goal of this project is to provide a well-tested and well-documented Python implementation with a good set of built-in functionality and numerous paths for extensibility.

Current features
================
* Support for STOMP v{[1.0](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.0.html), [1.1](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.1.html), [1.2](http://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html)}
* Works on Python {3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11}
* {Redis, Memory, RDBM} message store options
* Extendable via custom components

Status and Goals
================
The project is currently in beta state and the tip branch in repository should always be considered unstable. Milestones (of varying levels of stability) will be signified by releases.

At a high-level, this project aims to:

* Provide a correct and functional STOMP implementation
* Be well documented.
* Be easy to extend. (e.g. write new auth backend, queue storage)
* Be well tested.
